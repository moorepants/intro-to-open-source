Introduction
============

Welcome to the materials for the "Contributing to Open Source Projects"
tutorial for the first CSU IEEE Open Source Evening. We will spend about 2
hours learning how to collectively develop software and how to get involved in
popular open source projects. There will be interactive activities during the
tutorial so you will need to be prepared. Make sure to do all the goals in the
"Preparation" section below before you come to the event.

If you have a laptop, please bring that to the event. If you don't we will pair
you up with some anyways for pair programming.

Friday, September 12, 2014
5pm - 8pm
Fenn Hall Compton Lounge

Make sure to RSVP to CSUIEEE@gmail.com before September 9th, otherwise there
will not be enough food.

If you have any questions about the materials here send an email to Jason at
moorepants@gmail.com.

Preparation
===========

Goal #1: install a text editor
------------------------------

(Estimated completion time: 2 - 10 minutes)

We need a good text editor (not a word processor!) for editing code.

If you already have a preferred text editor, you can use it instead, but note
that word processors like Microsoft Word and programs like Notepad that don't
offer enough functionality will not work.

- [Windows](https://openhatch.org/wiki/PyCon_intro_to_open_source/Windows_text_editor)
- [MAC](https://openhatch.org/wiki/PyCon_intro_to_open_source/OSX_text_editor)
- [Linux](https://openhatch.org/wiki/PyCon_intro_to_open_source/Linux_text_editor)

Goal #2: install git
--------------------

(Estimated completion time: 5 minutes)

git is a popular version control system, which we'll use for managing and
collaborating on open source projects.

- [Windows](https://openhatch.org/wiki/PyCon_intro_to_open_source/Windows_git)
- [OSX](https://openhatch.org/wiki/PyCon_intro_to_open_source/OSX_git)
- [Linux](https://openhatch.org/wiki/PyCon_intro_to_open_source/Linux_git)

Goal #4 install Python
----------------------

(Estimated completion time: 5 minutes)

Python is a popular high level interpreted programming language that is taught
in many of introduction to computer science courses. We will use Python 2.7 to
collectively create a simple program during the tutorial.

- [Windows](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.8/)
- [OSX](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.8/): Python should be
  installed in OSX by default. Type Python in your terminal to check. If the
  interpreter doesn't start, then install from the link.
- [Linux] Python 2.7 will be installed by default in most Linux distributions.

Goal #5: create a GitHub account
--------------------------------

(Estimated completion time: 2 minutes)

GitHub is a popular website for hosting open source projects that use Git.
We'll use GitHub to collaborate on projects.

Please visit https://github.com/ now and create an account.

Goal #6: create a Gitter account
--------------------------------

(Estimated completion time: 2 minutes)

Gitter is a IRC-like chat room that is connected to Github and provides nice
tools for discussing code. You can log in with your Github account.

http://gitter.im

Goal #7: practice command line navigation
-----------------------------------------

(Estimated completion time: 10 - 15 minutes)

Many of the tools of open source development are primarily used via the command
line. Let's get some practice with navigating the computer from the command
line.

- [Windows](https://openhatch.org/wiki/PyCon_intro_to_open_source/Windows_terminal_navigation)
- [OS X](https://openhatch.org/wiki/PyCon_intro_to_open_source/OSX_terminal_navigation)
- [Linux](https://openhatch.org/wiki/PyCon_intro_to_open_source/Linux_terminal_navigation)
